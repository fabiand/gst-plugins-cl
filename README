About
-----
A couple of low level plugins to apply some OpenCL kernel to a Gst.Buffer (as a OpenCL buffer or image2d).
This can be used for many things:
- Color conversion
- Filtering
- Transforming
...

Oh, and everything GPU based (if it's a GPU OpenCL backend)

Features
--------
Can be used on various gst formats.

Required
--------
An OpenCL implementation like Intel OCL SDK, AMD's App Stream SDK or NVIDIA's GPU SDK.
Free implementations are currently untested (like clover or pocl).

Build
-----
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make

Use
---
$ export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=src/.libs/ 
$ gst-launch audiotestsrc ! clkernel ! autoaudiosink
$ gst-launch videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-rgb,framerate=60/1,width=$((1920 / 2)),height=$((1080 / 2))   ! ffmpegcolorspace   ! clvideofilter platform-idx=0 ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink

Future
------
Just past us ...
Allow creation of pipelines on the GPU. This is (at a first glance) not more than providing elements for pushing/fetching buffers onto/from the gpu and an element to send kernels to the gpu.
